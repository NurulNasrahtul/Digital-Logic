# DIGITAL LOGIC

This courses introduces me to digital electronics and provides a broad overview of many important concepts, components, and tools. I was able to get up to date coverage of digital fundamentals from basic concepts to programmable logic devices. The laboratory experiments that I had done provide hands-on experience with the simulator software, actual devices and circuits studied in the classroom.
